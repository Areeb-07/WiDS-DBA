# Driver Behaviour Analysis
This is a repository containing files associated with a project done under Winter in Data Science (WiDS) program by Analytics Club, Indian Institue of Technology, Bombay.

For the initial stage of this project, I teamed up with Sneha Kulkarni.

We looked for datasets on Driver Behaviour Analysis available on the internet and chose the following dataset to further work with - [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dasmehdixtr/carla-driver-behaviour-dataset)

Then we performed Exploratory Data Analysis to extract some useful insights from the dataset.

The next task was to classify the driver behaviour, which I did on my own. I trained various machine learning models and compared their accuracy.
